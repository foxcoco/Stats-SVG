*A highly customizable GitHub stats SVG generator*

This project generates a visually appealing, highly customizable SVG image displaying GitHub user statistics. It's designed to be embedded in GitHub profiles or other web pages to showcase a user's GitHub activity and contributions.

## Features

- Fetches real-time GitHub user data using the GitHub GraphQL API
- Generates a customizable SVG image with user stats, displaying various metrics including commits, language usage, and many more
- Supports custom color schemes, configurations, and animated elements
- For ranking and language usage calculation, this repo uses the same algorithm as arguably the most famous README card repo on GitHub, [anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats), to maintain consistency with the same standard.
